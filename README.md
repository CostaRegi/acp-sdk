## About The Project

The "Agent Connect Protocol SDK" is an open-source library designed to facilitate the adoption of the Agent Connect Protocol.
It offers tools for both client and server implementations, enabling seamless integration and communication between multi-agent systems.

### Components:

- **Agent Connect Protocol Client SDK**: A Python library providing function wrappers for the Agent Connect Protocol OpenAPI/REST calls.
It is designed for multi-agent applications where agents are remotely accessed.

- **Agent Connect Protocol Server SDK**: A Python library that simplifies exposing an Agent Connect Protocol interface from any agent.
It allows agents to be remotely consumed through the protocol and can be mapped to specific agent frameworks.
